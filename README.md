# Why Did I Write This Document?

As a junior developer, I often struggled to understand fundamental concepts. Sometimes, I encountered topics that were either too complex and hard to grasp or so superficial and scattered that they lacked depth. Many of the resources I studied either focused too much on minor details or simply skipped over essential concepts.  

For this reason, I decided to compile almost all the **fundamental and practical concepts** in a way that is both **simple and in-depth**. These concepts not only build a **solid foundation** for learning Angular but are also applicable in **real-world projects**.  

This document is the result of **real challenges, hands-on experiences, and deep analysis** of complex code that I have encountered throughout my learning journey. I have made every effort to explain each concept in the **simplest way possible** while maintaining **professional depth and insight** so that you can not only **understand them** but also **apply them in practice**.
