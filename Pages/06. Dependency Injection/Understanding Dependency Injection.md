# What is Dependency Injection (DI) in Angular

**Dependency Injection (DI)** is one of the core **software design principles** and a fundamental part of Angularâ€™s architecture. DI allows us to **supply dependencies from external sources** instead of having a class create them itself.

This approach helps to:

- Make the code **more readable and well-structured**.
- **Improve testability** by allowing dependencies to be mocked.
- Provide **better and more controlled dependency management**.

In the previous section, we discussed **[Services](../03.%20Services/service-dependency-injection.md)** in Angular, which are one of the most common use cases of **Dependency Injection**. In this section, we will explore **deeper concepts** related to DI.
